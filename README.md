## Overview

The purpose of this project was to preform an exlploratory analysis for the ride-share company PyBer. I was tasked with creating multiple types of visualizations to illustrate the differences in ride-share fares between rural, suburban, and urban cities. The goal is to help PyBer improve the access to ride-sharing services, and determine affordability for underserved areas.

Specifically, Omar and mylsef created a summary DataFrame of ride-share data by city type (Rural, Suburban, Urban). Then we created a multuple line graph to show the total weekly fares from each city type between 1/1/2019 and 4/29/2019.

The table above describes the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. The most noteable differences among the city types are as follows:

  1. Urban cities account for a siginificant portion of total rides and total drivers. Rural cities account for the lowest number of total total rides and total drivers.   Suburban city data for total rides and drivers was inbetween urban and rural figures.
  
  2. Urban cities had the highest amount of total fares at nearly $40,000. This is significantly higher than the average for rural cities ($4,328). Again, suburban cities were in the middle at a total fare amount of around $19,000.
  
  3 Average fare per ride was highest for rural cities ($34.62), which is $10 more than the average in urban cities ($24.53). The suburban average fare was in between urban and rural at $30.97.

  4 Rural cities also had the highest average fare per driver ($55.49) compared to suburban ($39.50) and urban ($16.57) fares per driver.
